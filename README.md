Tagged Hackathon Fall 2013
__________________________

This is a game developed for Tagged that allows users to play Tag with people by Tagging them with Tags. Tag, tag, tag, tag, tag. 

When you recieve a tag, you only have a limited amount of time to use it to re-tag someone else. When you re-tag someone else, you'll get the points for that tag. But what out! If you're left with a tag when the timer runs out then those points will be deducted from your score.

Have fun!
